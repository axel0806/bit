## About the company

Balder IT Konsult UF was started in 2026 by a group of upper-secondary students in Skellefteå. The name comes from the Norse god Balder, known for wisdom and light. As a UF company we run a real business during the school year: we quote, deliver and invoice like any consultancy, just on a smaller scale.

**Services**

- **Web development:** websites and simple web shops that are fast, clear and easy to update
- **IT support & advice:** troubleshooting, cloud services and training
- **Digitalisation:** mapping manual routines and suggesting simple tools that save time
